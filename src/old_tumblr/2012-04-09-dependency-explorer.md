From everyone I’ve talked with most developers would be interested in a way of exploring the full global ‘open source software dependency web’.

It seems like an idea whose time has come, but I can’t seem to find a site that has that kind of info.  I’d like to do this for all all languages but I think java with maven would be the easiest to tackle first.

The hard part oddly enough is getting access to the data.

Not an insurmountable problem but one that might take a bit of consistent pushing to overcome.
