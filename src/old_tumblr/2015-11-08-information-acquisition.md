I spent the afternoon grooming my own personal collection of RSS feeds down to about 100 or so (from 200+) and plopping them into feedly as a temporary home.

I still feel the pain of Google Reader being shut down.

Since GR’s demise I have found myself more or less giving up on RSS. Like a digital hobo wandering from town to town, more and more I use sites like reddit or hackernews to filter the never-ending avalanche of information that I feel I must keep up with.

The problem with this approach is that it is a sort of one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that demands personalization. It’s like shopping at walmart for your information diet. It’s cheap and it works good enough to get by, but it is nowhere near the best one could do.

Sadly, feedly is missing the most useful feature of Google Reader: the ability to sort by the articles that were the most attention-worthy (GR had a cute name for this but it escapes me).

If only there was a service that would allow me to easily import/export my opml data and twist the knobs to sort articles by various measures of relevance, popularity, etc…
