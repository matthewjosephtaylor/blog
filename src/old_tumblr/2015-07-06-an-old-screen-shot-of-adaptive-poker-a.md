An old screen shot  of ‘Adaptive Poker’, a player-vs-bot poker program I wrote more than a decade ago. Shareware when that was still a thing. I didn’t strike it rich, but I sold a few copies. Oddly I sold quite a few more after someone cracked it (it had a nag screen as I recall) and posted it to a cracker forum. That day I learned that piracy is a heck of a good marketing tool. It was actually pretty good (Bot was a custom neural net that learned from the player, honing in on their weaknesses). Thinking of scrounging the source code to remake it into a webapp using Vaadin.
