I just finished reading Docker: Up and Running by Karl Matthias. I’m getting to the point where I view Docker (or perhaps one of its competitors like LXD but my money is on Docker) as one of the core technologies that is going to drive the next wave of internet applications. Easily distributable lightweight containers, and infrastructure as a service are a seductive and powerful combination.

Up to this point I’ve been relying on the documentation from Docker’s website for the majority of my knowledge. This has been a good resource, but it lacks some history, detail and vision that are better suited to book format.

Overall I’ll give the book a 3.5/5.

After reading, I now know a thing or two about docker’s internals and best practices that I didn’t know before, which are the sort of things that are difficult to glean solely from the docs, and my main reason for reading the book. For me the later chapters, especially Chapter 8 (Debugging Containers) were the most useful. Unfortunately the early chapters didn’t seem to offer much more what one would get from reading the documentation on the website. The last chapters consist of riffing off of the The 12 factor app and The Reactive Manifesto and how Docker fits into those world-views.

It’s possible that I’m being a bit too harsh, and that I was really looking for something beyond what a book with the title ‘up and running’ was likely to provide. However, it just felt like there was a little too much filler and not enough technical punch to this book.

I have a few more Docker books lined up in my safari queue, hopefully one of them will be the Docker-bible type book I seem to be craving.
