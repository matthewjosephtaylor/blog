# Language
- everything is a function, most functions have names
    - if it doesn't have a name then it is a 'lambda' which is really just a name where the name and the definition are the same, so really they all have names just some names are defitions 'within themselves' ('evaluate-able names').
- function arguments are scoped contexts (aka already defined names)
    - nice because it limits the existing 'vocabulary'
    - the 'program' has a _lot_ of already defined names and can be thought of as arguments to the function that are implicitly passed to 'all functions'
        - all the integer, boolean, etc... 'simple value' names
        - all the branching/looping 'logic' names
        - all the 'string litteral' values
        - those 'system' names could be given a context name but that would be tedious to type 'sys.5', 'sys.if' instead of '5' and 'if'
- functions names can optionally be in the context of a type that is simply a function that takes the name and returns true if that name satisfies a set of conditions
- functions _return_ defined names  (that is what they are really, just name definers)
- time is ordering, and happens in local western human context top->bottom left ->right
- properties are simply names in the context of other names (partial function application)
    - 5.blueShirt is a name given 5
    - heirchy
- 'arguments' and context are really the same thing. There are just previously defined names.
- multiple returns in a function are the same as 'object properties'
- 'returns' are names in the context of the funciton defiition.
    - 5.blueShirt is the name 'blueShirt' returned within the function '5' 
- functions _can_ define names and not return them
- some functions don't have returns, or do but we don't care about them
- returns are just partially applied functions
    - there is a natural 'ordering' of the return since the function is evaluated from top->bottom, left->right
        - that means that function returns can be 'named' ('identified') by their ordering as well as by their 'given' name
- ordering and time are synonimous

# Program
- programs are simply functions in the context of a lot of previously defined names
    - default already defined names
    - default already defined types
    - integer type makes sure that the name is one of the integer-names
    - intesger 'values'
        - values are simply another word for a function that has no arguments/context
            - '5' is just a name (A special one that the machine has been taught to 'understand')
    - boolean 'values'
        - true
        - false
    - binary 'values'
        - 0
        - 1
    - convetion: when the first letter is capitalized it is a 'type'

- function definitions are _returns_ with 'logic' above them

# Logic
- 'logic' is conditional naming
    - if x then name 'y' is defined as....
        - bar = if (2 > foo) -> {
            return alice
        }
    - looping is careless 'throwing away' of names to get to the one you want (auto-nested 'if')
        - those poor names that are never ever used...why would you do such a thing?
            - easier to think this way (oddly because it is really a very advanced sort of 'macro')

- 'if' is simply a named funciton that returns the first or second name depending on how the names compare
- comparison 'operators' are functions that return 'true'/'false' given two names
- 'for' is simply a named function that auto-generates funcitons taht take as argumens the results of the previous 'iteration'
    - really advanced stuff
