I've reached the point where my current blogging toolsets are getting in the way, and I need to make it easier for me to write.

### I've made some decisions:

- Markdown has won the text with a bit of markup challenge for myself and perhaps even the world.
- The 'front matter' --- thing is perfect, and appears to be winning.
- I want absolute control over storage of my content.
	- Treat it just like any other 'source' I write (backups, git, etc...)
- Separate content from delivery systems.
- Whatever makes it easy for me to write content wins. Presentation can come later.
- I organize the content to my liking, and ability to reason about.
  - I will tailor whatever the current best tools are for generating appealing display text.

### Still need to think about: 
- How best to store image/video/large-bloby data I want to reference?
	- archive.org is great...until it goes away
	- IPFS?
